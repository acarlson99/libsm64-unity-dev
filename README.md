# libsm64-unity-dev

This repo contains a Unity project that wraps the [libsm64-unity](https://github.com/libsm64/libsm64-unity) package so it can be easily worked on directly inside Unity without going through the package manager.

To get started:
- Clone this repository
- Make sure to recursively clone submodules `git submodule update --init --recursive`
- Open the project in Unity 2019.3.10, open the pipes test scene, and run it
